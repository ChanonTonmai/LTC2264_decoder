Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1.
